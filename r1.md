# r1

## Our first simple REPL

REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print and Loop. It is a tool common to most intereted languages.  We are going to use two Go packages to make our first REPL called r1.

As usual we'll create a directory under *cmds*, add our file, then build the program with the `go build` command.

```
  cd $GOPATH/src/replweather
  mkdir -p cmds/r1
  micro cmds/r1/r1.go
  go build cmds/r1/r1.go
```
