# r1

## Our first simple REPL

REPL stands for Read, Evaluate, Print and Loop. It is a tool common to most interpreted languages.  We are going to use two Go packages to make our first REPL called r1.

As usual we'll create a directory under *cmds*, add our file, then build the program with the `go build` command.

```
  cd $GOPATH/src/replweather
  mkdir -p cmds/r1
  micro cmds/r1/r1.go
  go build cmds/r1/r1.go
```

Go command line programs can be thought of having a few general parts

1. Package declariation
2. Imported package list
3. Declaration of globals (e.g. variables, constants, common structures and types)
4. Useful functions needed to implement the program (e.g. processing options, calculating output, handling input, etc)
5. Initialization
6. Main function

It is usually helpful to sprinkle some comments around as well. Go provide excellent tooling for generating documentation from embed comments so take advantage of that where you can.
